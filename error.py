My solution to Rosalind Bioinformatics Problem 034

Title: Error Correction in Reads
Rosalind ID: CORR
Rosalind #: 034
URL: http://rosalind.info/problems/corr

Goal to return sequences from a collection that are incorrect and the
respective correction separated by '->'
'''

''' 2 Rules for Detecting Incorrect Reads

    1. S is correct if appears in dataset at least twice
    (normal or reverse complement)
    2. S is incorrect if appears only once and Hamming distance
    is 1 with respect to one of the correct reads (normal or revc)

    correct = []
    incorrect = []
    for s in counts:
        if counts[s] >= 2:
            correct.append(s)
        elif s in orig_seqs:
            incorrect.append(s)
    return correct, incorrect


def hamming(seq1, seq2):
    mutations = 0
    for i in range(len(seq1)):
        if seq1[i] != seq2[i]:
            mutations += 1
    return mutations
